# HydraBridge ESP32

## Legal Notice

HydraBridge ESP32 is an independent, open-source interoperability project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or approved by AquaIllumination, Mobius®, or their owners.

This project was reverse engineered using a clean-room method solely to enable local interoperability with the author's personally owned AquaIllumination Hydra® lights in a personal PLC reef controller. The repository is intended to contain independently written code, protocol documentation, and functional facts needed for interoperability only; it does not include vendor firmware, vendor source code, vendor application code, copyrighted artwork, cloud services, or product keys.

Under U.S. law, this project is intended to rely on the interoperability reverse-engineering provisions of [17 U.S.C. § 1201(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201), which permit identifying, analyzing, and sharing information necessary for interoperability of independently created computer programs, and on fair-use principles under [17 U.S.C. § 107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107). U.S. courts have recognized this kind of software reverse engineering and clean-room reimplementation for compatibility in cases including:

- [Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992)](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/summaries/segaenters-accolade-9thcir1992.pdf), recognizing reverse engineering of software to access unprotected functional elements needed for compatibility as fair use.
- [Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/203/596/474793/), recognizing intermediate copying during reverse engineering as fair use when used to build a non-infringing interoperable implementation.
- [Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 387 F.3d 522 (6th Cir. 2004)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/387/522/532493/), rejecting an overbroad use of the DMCA to block interoperable replacement components and warning against using access controls to create replacement-part monopolies.
- [Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1992)](https://digital-law-online.info/cases/23PQ2D1241.htm), applying abstraction-filtration-comparison principles and recognizing that independently rewritten software constrained by functional requirements can avoid copyright infringement.

HydraBridge ESP32 is an open-source gateway that connects AquaIllumination Hydra® lights to industrial and home automation systems.

Local control for AquaIllumination Hydra® lights over RS485 and MQTT.

Features include:

- Automatic Hydra® light discovery
- Local BLE communication
- MQTT integration
- RS485 communication
- Home Assistant auto-discovery
- Reusable lighting profiles
- Scheduled lighting control
- Sunrise and sunset ramping
- Multi-light group support
- Fully local operation with no cloud dependency

This ESP32-S3 controller talks to **AquaIllumination Hydra®** lights directly over BLE using the reverse-engineered myAI / Mobius® protocol, with MQTT integration and a Modbus RTU slave register map for PLC integration.

**Target hardware**: This project is developed and release-tested for the [Waveshare ESP32-S3-RS485-CAN](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-RS485-CAN#Onboard_Resources). That board provides the expected ESP32-S3 MCU, 2.4 GHz WiFi/BLE, 16MB flash, USB-C flashing/debug, wide-range screw-terminal power input, and onboard isolated RS485 hardware.

Other ESP32-S3 boards can run HydraBridge ESP32, but may need changes before flashing: confirm flash size and partition layout, wire or add an RS485 transceiver if you need Modbus, update RS485 GPIOs in Settings or defaults, and verify USB/serial flashing behavior for that board. BLE, WiFi, MQTT, and the web UI do not require the Waveshare RS485/CAN hardware.

## What works today

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| FSCI / myAI protocol codec | ✅ Byte-exact verified against captured hardware traces (CRC, builder, parser, reassembly) |
| Channel model + presets | ✅ 9-channel Hydra® 64HD set, 5 built-in presets (`off`, `on`, `moonlight`, `blue_moonlight`, `test_25`) |
| LiveDemoScene payload builder | ✅ Reproduces every captured On/Off/LBM/Moonlight TX frame byte-for-byte |
| Light registry + command queue | ✅ 4 lights, 4 groups, per-light FIFO with coalescing, NVS persistence |
| Command engine | ✅ Unified `ce_request_t` → validate → expand → enqueue from any source |
| Modbus RTU slave | ✅ Optional ESP-Modbus RTU slave; disabled by default, configurable from the web UI |
| Modbus register map | ✅ Full spec map (system + 4 light + 4 group blocks) with result codes 1:1 to `ce_result_t` |
| MQTT bridge | ✅ Optional MQTT client; disabled by default; configurable from the web UI; light/group command subscriptions and result topics |
| OTA partition + rollback | ✅ Two app slots, `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` on good boot |
| WiFi setup portal | ✅ First-boot setup hotspot at `HydraBridge-Setup` / `http://192.168.1.10/`, configurable from Settings |
| NimBLE central (scan / connect / GATT) | ⏳ Stubbed; first hardware session |
| BLE worker task (drains queue → writes) | ⏳ Stubbed; first hardware session |
| Web UI | ✅ Local browser UI for discovery, lights, groups, profiles, RS485, and MQTT settings |
| Home Assistant discovery | ✅ Optional MQTT discovery publishing when MQTT is enabled and the HA checkbox is on |

Today: a PLC can speak Modbus to the controller and see the queue accept commands. The light won't actually light until the BLE worker lands in the first hardware session.

## Quickstart

Nontechnical users should start with the release firmware zip instead of building from source:

1. Download the latest `hydrabridge-esp32-firmware-*.zip` from GitHub Releases.
2. Flash it with `flash.sh` on Linux/macOS or `flash.ps1` on Windows.
3. Connect to the first-boot `HydraBridge-Setup` WiFi hotspot.
4. Open `http://192.168.1.10/` and save your home WiFi settings.

Full steps are in [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

## Build From Source

Install ESP-IDF 5.4+, then:

```bash
. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

`esp-modbus` is pulled automatically via the IDF Component Registry on first configure.

## Host tests

Pure-C modules (protocol codec, channel model, presets, registries, queue, engine, Modbus store, MQTT parser) compile to a Linux binary using Unity:

```bash
. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh   # Unity is pulled from $IDF_PATH/components/unity
cmake -S host_tests -B host_tests/build
cmake --build host_tests/build
./host_tests/build/host_tests
```

Currently **170 tests** across 12 test files. Every captured CRC, every captured TX/RX frame, every preset, every Modbus register dispatch path, and every MQTT payload shape is covered.

## RS485 / Modbus quick start

RS485 is disabled by default. Enable it from the web UI `RS485 Slave` section, then configure the external Modbus master with matching settings:

| Setting | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Slave address | `10` | NVS (`mb_cfg` namespace) |
| Baud | `19200` | NVS |
| Data/stop bits | `8` / `1` | Fixed by bundled ESP-Modbus serial port |
| Parity | `even` | Web UI / NVS |
| UART TX / RX / DE pins | `17 / 18 / 4` | Web UI / NVS |

A Modbus master reads, once RS485 is enabled:

```
register 0  → 0xA164    (magic; if you see this the controller is alive)
register 1  → 1         (register-map version)
register 16 → 1         (modbus_status = slave_ready)
```

To turn light 0 on, write command code first and sequence last:

```
register 1006 → 2   (command_code = ON)
register 1005 → 1   (command_seq = new sequence)
```

The controller picks up the `command_seq` increment, dispatches via `command_engine`, and writes the result code to register `1003`. Full usage docs are in [`docs/rs485-modbus-protocol.md`](docs/rs485-modbus-protocol.md), with constants in [`components/modbus_interface/include/modbus_registers.h`](components/modbus_interface/include/modbus_registers.h).
